## Dev Setup

```bash
poetry install
poetry install -E atari
poetry install -E pybullet
```

Then you can run the scripts under the poetry environment in two ways: `poetry run` or `poetry shell`. 

* `poetry run`:
    By prefixing `poetry run`, your command will run in poetry's virtual environment. For example, try running
    ```bash
    poetry run python vdqn.py
    ```
* `poetry shell`:
    First, activate the poetry's virtual environment by executing `poetry shell`. Then, the name of the poetry's
    virtual environment (e.g. `(vectorized-value-methods-T4LxsEjE-py3.9)`) should appear in the left side of your shell.
    Afterwards, you can directly run
    ```bash
    python python vdqn.py
    ```


## Code Formatting

We use [Pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) for code formatting, sorting inputs and other utilities. You can run the following command:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```
